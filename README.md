# EDA---Google-Playstore-Dataset-2014---2018
EDA on Google Play Store dataset (2014–2018) to analyze app categories, ratings, reviews, installs, and pricing. Includes data cleaning and visualization to uncover key trends and insights using Python.
# Introduction

With the rapid growth of smartphones and mobile applications, app marketplaces have become extremely competitive. The Google Play Store is one of the largest digital distribution platforms, hosting millions of Android applications across various categories such as Games, Education, Business, Health, and Entertainment. These apps differ widely in terms of popularity, user ratings, size, pricing, and installation counts.

This project performs EDA and Feature Engineering on the Google Play Store dataset to gain insights into app performance and user preferences. The analysis aims to identify the most popular app categories, the applications with the highest number of installs, largest app sizes, and other key factors that influence an app’s success. These insights can help developers, marketers, and business stakeholders make informed decisions regarding app development, optimization, and market strategy.

The data consists of 20 column and 10841 rows.
